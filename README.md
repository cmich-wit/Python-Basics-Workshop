# 🐍 WiT Python Education Series

**Last Updated:** February 19, 2025  
**Developed for:** Women in Technology (WiT) Spring Educational Series – Weeks of February 19 & February 26, 2025

## 📌 Overview
This educational mini-series was designed by the **Women in Technology (WiT)** organization at **Central Michigan University** to introduce beginners to Python programming in a fun, interactive, and supportive environment. The materials span basic Python concepts, hands-on exercises, and real-world challenges, fostering both learning and community engagement.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this workshop series is to:
- Introduce **basic programming principles** using Python
- Empower students from **non-traditional or underrepresented backgrounds**
- Foster curiosity and confidence through **hands-on activities**
- Create a **safe space** for trying, failing, and growing with code

## 📁 Materials

### 🗂️ Presentations
#### `Python week 1.pptx`
- **Topic:** Intro to Python & Its Ecosystem  
- **Content Highlights:**
  - Python history, facts, and simplicity vs other languages
  - Common uses: data analytics, automation, AI, web development
  - Python vs Java comparison
  - Core syntax: variables, loops, functions, lists, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming
  - Resources to continue learning

#### `Python Week 2.pptx`
- **Topic:** Python in Practice
